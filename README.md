# DICECII
BETA

Basically just using grid mapping and rust image library to map blocks to an enum based on pixel data obtained by image crate.


To do:
- rewrite
- licensing
- rearrange and clean code into library rust crate for potential other use cases (high level... using other images than "dice".
- rewrite
- add more "use-case" functions, rearrange app accordingly.
- fix tons of ðŸ’©
- rewrite

Buildable and usable CLI app out of the box as is. Build... run... you got it. 
Works best with square images... 2048x2048+ ideally. Reccomended 16 or 32 dice. 
Has support for custom output sizes. Fills blank areas with background dice and centers image without distorting.
