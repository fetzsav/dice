## Image to Mapped Dice "ASCII" Art
![dice_output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/812e5a45-6e1a-4a2a-9981-0d520944ebd2)

A CLI app that transforms any image into a unique representation using dice faces as "ASCII" art. The app analyzes the grayscale intensity of each pixel in the image and maps it to a corresponding dice face (1-6). Resulting in a dice-based representation of the image.

Usable in it's current state. Potential to release on Linux repos in the future.

- Core logic is built around square images, although have began to veer towards supporting a more dynamic range of input (and output) images.
- Needs alot of code cleanup and orginization
- Possibility to add to Linux repos later as installable package
